MaxQuant, Perseus, and related software packages are developed by the [Computational Systems Biochemistry](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/cox/index.html) under Prof. Jürgen Cox.

If you need to contact the developers, you have a few options to proceed:

- If you think something is misspelled or unclear in the documentation, consider changing it yourself (creating a pull request is quite easy).
- If you have found a bug in the software or want to make a feature request, please create an issue on [our github repository](https://github.com/cox-labs/CoxLab_Bug_Reporting).

If you have a general usage question, ask it on [the appropriate Google group](https://maxquant.org/community/).


We are also always on the lookout for promising canditates. In case you are interested in becoming a Master's/PhD student or a postdoc, we encourage you to apply at all time via e-mail to [Jürgen Cox](mailto:cox@biochem.mpg.de).

Or connect with us on GitHub, Twitter, or Linkedin (links in top right).
